            <li>He was of middle economic status. Socrates was not born into nobility he had very minimal Greek education and learned masonry from his father at a tender age.</li>
            <li>He made money from teaching. Many believe that Socrates did not make money from teaching, though some people say that his main source of money, especially in the early days, were from teaching. </li>
            <li>No belief in religion. Socrates was not a fan of religion; in fact, he attracted many enemies because he tried to convert young people from religion.</li>
            <li>He died by hemlock poisoning. His friends wanted to bribe the guards so that Socrates could escape his death; which he was sentenced to- hemlock poisoning,</li>
            <li>He did not leave any recorded teachings behind. His discoveries and teachings on epistemology were recorded and taught by his students Xenophon and Plato. </li>
            <li>Famous teacher. So great was his work, that Socrates is known to have taught Alexander the Great- between 356-323 BCE, Plato, Aristotle and many more. </li>
            <li>Know thyself. Socrates had a motto- Know thyself, which meant that people ought to examine their lives. He came up with the Socratic questioning, which meant he taught by drawing answers from his pupils. </li>
            <li>Socrates was a soldier! A war would be something that was against Socrates’ philosophies going by his teachings, but he took the compulsory military service training and served in the military during the Peloponnesian War, the battle of Amphipolis, the battle of Potidaea; he saved the life of the Athenian General Alcibiades.</li>
            <li>He might have been a democrat! Many things point to Socrates have been a democrat, for example, he served in the military, he refused to aid in the finding of the democratic General, Leon who was supposed to be executed and had a lot of people who were democrats as his disciples. </li>
            <li>He was openly bisexual! Socrates was married to a woman Xanthippe and even had children- Menexenus, Lamprocles, and Sophroniscus, but he was known to being openly bisexual, often claiming to be attracted to younger men. </li>
